/*
Package caret encodes, and decodes caret text (i.e., where ASCII control codes are in caret notation) into UTF-8 text (which may also be ASCII text).

This can be useful for writing, or reading text that contains ANSI escape codes, such as ANSI color codes.

Note that Caret Notation code note have a good way of representing the caret in the output text.

This is a limit in inherent to Caret Notation.
